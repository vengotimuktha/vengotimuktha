# Mukthasree Vengoti

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a data scientist and machine learning practitioner with a strong focus on applied NLP, generative AI, and scalable data engineering solutions. My portfolio showcases production-grade projects built with transparency, explainability, and real-world deployment in mind.

I specialize in turning unstructured data into actionable insights using advanced ML techniques, explainability tools, and modern cloud-native architecture. This GitHub serves as a central hub for the AI/ML systems I have independently designed, developed, and deployed using technologies such as Spark, LangChain, BERT, FastAPI, Streamlit, and BigQuery.

## Featured Projects

### Enterprise BI Agent
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/enterprise-bi-agent](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/enterprise-bi-agent)  
A modular Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying unstructured PDF and CSV files using LangChain, OpenAI, Spark, and ChromaDB. Includes metadata indexing, semantic search, secure FastAPI services, and Power BI integration for real-time business intelligence.

### YouTube Sentiment Analyzer
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/youtube-sentiment-analyzer](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/youtube-sentiment-analyzer)  
**Live App:** [youtube--sentiment--analyzer.streamlit.app](https://youtube--sentiment--analyzer.streamlit.app)  
A production-grade sentiment classification system using fine-tuned BERT with SHAP, LIME, and Captum explainability. Features include rule-based moderation, token-level insights, batch processing, and a Streamlit Cloud deployment with Docker.

### Loan Risk Analytics (GCP)
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/loan-risk-analytics-gcp](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/loan-risk-analytics-gcp)  
End-to-end cloud-native dashboard using BigQuery and Looker to analyze over 10 million loan records. Includes interactive filters, risk flags, KPIs, and SQL-optimized data modeling for sub-second response times.

### Climate Forecasting with GPR, LSTM, ARIMA
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/climate-forecasting-gpr-lstm-arima](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/climate-forecasting-gpr-lstm-arima)  
Probabilistic forecasting model for long-term climate trends using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), ARIMA, and LSTM. Includes quantified uncertainty, seasonal trend decomposition, and RMSE/MAE benchmarking.

### Privacy Risk Modeling on ECB Payments
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/privacy-risk-modeling-ecb-payments](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/privacy-risk-modeling-ecb-payments)  
A GDPR-aligned privacy-preserving ML pipeline that predicts payment behavior from ECB transaction data while stratifying sensitive variables into risk tiers. Includes anonymization logic and Random Forest interpretation.

### SkyVision AI
**Repo:** [github.com/vengotimuktha/skyvision_ai_final](https://github.com/vengotimuktha/skyvision_ai_final)  
GenAI-powered document Q&A platform built using LangChain, OpenAI, and FAISS. Supports semantic chunking, query tracking, source highlighting, and secure deployment via Google Cloud Run and Docker.
