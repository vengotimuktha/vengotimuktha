# Mukthasree Vengoti

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I am a data scientist and machine learning practitioner with a strong focus on applied NLP, generative AI, and scalable data engineering solutions. My portfolio showcases production-grade projects built with transparency, explainability, and real-world deployment.

I specialize in turning unstructured data into actionable insights using advanced ML techniques, explainability tools, and modern cloud-native architecture. This GitHub serves as a central hub for the AI/ML systems I have independently designed, developed, and deployed using technologies such as Spark, LangChain, BERT, FastAPI, Streamlit, and BigQuery.

##  About Me

I'm a data scientist and ML practitioner specializing in NLP, GenAI, and data engineering, with a proven track record of building real-world solutions across healthcare-adjacent, risk modeling, and analytics domains.

I've developed scalable pipelines using Spark, PySpark, and BigQuery, and built production-ready ML systems with BERT, SHAP, and LangChain — deployed via Docker and Streamlit.

**My recent work includes:**
- A BERT-based sentiment analyzer with SHAP, LIME, Captum, and rule-based moderation logic.
- A GenAI-powered RAG pipeline using LangChain + PySpark for enterprise document intelligence.
- A Looker + BigQuery dashboard supporting 10M+ loan records with sub-second response time.
- Climate forecasting using GPR, ARIMA, and LSTM with quantified uncertainty (RMSE: 0.26).

I’ve also designed A/B testing pipelines using Python and SQL, optimized stakeholder dashboards, and automated workflows that reduced reporting time by 40%.
