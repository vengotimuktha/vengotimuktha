# Mukthasree Vengoti

## About Me

I am a results-driven Data Scientist and AI Engineer with hands-on expertise in building scalable machine learning systems, natural language processing pipelines, and Generative AI applications. My work spans applied NLP, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and real-time data engineering — deployed in production with strong emphasis on explainability, performance, and usability.

With a background in Data Science and a strong foundation in Python, Spark, and cloud platforms like GCP, I’ve designed and deployed intelligent solutions for sentiment analysis, document intelligence, and risk analytics. I’m passionate about solving real-world problems by combining deep technical knowledge with a pragmatic understanding of business and user needs.
