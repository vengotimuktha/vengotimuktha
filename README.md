# Mukthasree Vengoti

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I design and deploy real-world AI systems that transform messy, unstructured data into explainable, scalable, and production-grade insights â€” from GenAI-powered document Q&A pipelines to BigQuery dashboards with sub-second analytics.

My focus lies in applied NLP, generative AI, and cloud-native data engineering. This GitHub showcases the ML pipelines and AI solutions Iâ€™ve independently built using tools like Spark, LangChain, BERT, FastAPI, Streamlit, and BigQuery â€” all with a strong emphasis on transparency and explainability.

##  About Me

I'm a data scientist and ML practitioner specializing in NLP, GenAI, and data engineering, with a proven track record of building real-world solutions across healthcare-adjacent, risk modeling, and analytics domains.

I've developed scalable pipelines using Spark, PySpark, and BigQuery, and built production-ready ML systems with BERT, SHAP, and LangChain â€” deployed via Docker and Streamlit.

**My recent work includes:**
- A BERT-based sentiment analyzer with SHAP, LIME, Captum, and rule-based moderation logic.
- A GenAI-powered RAG pipeline using LangChain + PySpark for enterprise document intelligence.
- A Looker + BigQuery dashboard supporting 10M+ loan records with sub-second response time.
- Climate forecasting using GPR, ARIMA, and LSTM with quantified uncertainty (RMSE: 0.26).

Iâ€™ve also designed A/B testing pipelines using Python and SQL, optimized stakeholder dashboards, and automated workflows that reduced reporting time by 40%.
