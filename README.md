# Mukthasree Vengoti

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I design and deploy real-world AI systems that transform messy, unstructured data into explainable, scalable, and production-grade insights â€” from GenAI-powered document Q&A pipelines to BigQuery dashboards with sub-second analytics.

My focus lies in applied NLP, generative AI, and cloud-native data engineering. This GitHub showcases the ML pipelines and AI solutions Iâ€™ve independently built using tools like Spark, LangChain, BERT, FastAPI, Streamlit, and BigQuery â€” all with a strong emphasis on transparency and explainability.

##  About Me

I'm Mukthasree Vengoti â€” a data scientist and machine learning practitioner passionate about turning unstructured data into real-world, explainable solutions.

I specialize in applied NLP, generative AI, and scalable data engineering. From building sentiment analyzers with token-level interpretability to designing enterprise-grade RAG pipelines, I focus on systems that are both **technically robust** and **deployable in production**.

My work spans across:
- End-to-end ML pipelines with BERT, SHAP, LangChain, and FastAPI  
- Cloud-native deployments using Docker, Streamlit Cloud, and GCP (Cloud Run, BigQuery)  
- Business reporting via Power BI and Looker dashboards  
- Experimental research with LLMs, prompt engineering, and explainability

What sets me apart is a strong blend of:
- **ML modeling + system design**
- **Explainability + moderation features**
- **Data storytelling + stakeholder integration**

Whether it's modeling risk from 10M+ loan records or creating semantic search over regulatory PDFs, I thrive on building **transparent, scalable, and usable AI systems** from scratch.

Always open to collaboration, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.

##  Work Experience

**Generative AI Engineer**  
**Reality AI Lab** â€¢ Remote â€¢ Feb 2024 â€“ Present  
- Partnered with a cross-functional team of 15+ engineers and compliance experts to design and deploy an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system 
automating compliance-heavy financial and mortgage workflows. 
- Built a hybrid AI pipeline integrating OCR (Tesseract), DistilBERT + LayoutLM for document classification and extraction, and GPT-4 (via LangChain + 
FAISS) for semantic Q&A, delivering sub-100ms query responses. 
- Processed 1,000+ unstructured financial documents (Loan Estimates, Closing Disclosures, W-2, 1040, Bank Statements), reducing manual review by 
80% and accelerating decision-making. 
- Fine-tuned DistilBERT, achieving 86% accuracy (F1: 0.85) for multi-class classification, and developed regex + LayoutLM hybrid extraction ensuring 99% 
precision for APR, SSN, and tax fields while enforcing PII masking and RBAC controls. 
- Developed and deployed FastAPI-based microservices for model inference and compliance Q&A, integrated with Airflow + MLflow for orchestration, 
and containerized on GCP Cloud Run with CI/CD for 99.9% uptime and 60% faster retraining cycles.
