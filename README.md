# Mukthasree Vengoti

I am a GCP DevOps Engineer with 3+ years of hands-on experience in automating CI/CD pipelines, managing Kubernetes (GKE) clusters, and optimizing cloud performance and cost across multi-environment deployments. I specialize in Terraform-based Infrastructure as Code, Jenkins, Cloud Build, Docker, and secure, scalable automation with strong focus on IAM and Cloud Monitoring.

Along with my industry experience, I am completing my Master’s in Data Science in the USA, where I design and deploy real-world AI and ML systems. I build scalable pipelines that transform messy, unstructured data into explainable insights — ranging from GenAI-powered document Q&A, applied NLP, and LLM workflows, to BigQuery analytics dashboards.

This GitHub showcases the end-to-end AI, ML, and DevOps solutions I’ve built independently using tools like Spark, LangChain, BERT, FastAPI, Streamlit, GKE, and BigQuery, with a strong emphasis on reliability, transparency, automation, and production readiness.

##  About Me

I'm Mukthasree Vengoti — a data scientist and machine learning practitioner passionate about turning unstructured data into real-world, explainable solutions.

I specialize in applied NLP, generative AI, and scalable data engineering. From building sentiment analyzers with token-level interpretability to designing enterprise-grade RAG pipelines, I focus on systems that are both **technically robust** and **deployable in production**.

My work spans across:
- End-to-end ML pipelines with BERT, SHAP, LangChain, and FastAPI  
- Cloud-native deployments using Docker, Streamlit Cloud, and GCP (Cloud Run, BigQuery)  
- Business reporting via Power BI and Looker dashboards  
- Experimental research with LLMs, prompt engineering, and explainability

What sets me apart is a strong blend of:
- **ML modeling + system design**
- **Explainability + moderation features**
- **Data storytelling + stakeholder integration**

Whether it's modeling risk from 10M+ loan records or creating semantic search over regulatory PDFs, I thrive on building **transparent, scalable, and usable AI systems** from scratch.

Always open to collaboration, learning, and pushing the boundaries of what AI can do.
